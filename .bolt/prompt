note: our target is update our existing entire php project. this will be directly the project dir's files automatically, i don't want to manually copy and update the file.

- Complete each step fully before moving to the next
- Test each feature in isolation before integration
- Keep commits small and focused
- Document any deviations from the plan
- Update this tracker after completing each step

keep updated the track.md for completed progress, keep the track.md smaller to lower token use
